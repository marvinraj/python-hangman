-- how does the game work?
- display dashes in replace of letters
- display number of lives left
- user types in a letter
    - if letter in word, display letter instead of a dash
    - if letter not in word, reduce number of lives
- game restarts

-- maybe?
- insert a clue for each word.
- insert a new clue after every failure to guess?

---------------------------------------------------------------------

example --

--DISPLAY 1 :
'Welcome to Hangman! A word will be chosen at random and
you must try to guess the word correctly letter by letter
before you run out of attempts. Good luck!'

ready to play? Y or N


-- DISPLAY 2 :
Guess the following word! Please select a letter between A-Z

_ _ _ _ _ _

number of lives : 10
letters guessed but not in word : a, x, y


-- DISPLAY 3 :
Guess the following word! Please select a letter between A-Z

_ b _ _ _ _

number of lives : 10
letters guessed but not in word : a, x, y
